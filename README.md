🔧 API Integration
The chatbot is designed to easily integrate with AI APIs:

Backend Implementation
To use a real API (like OpenAI), you'll need to:

Set up a backend server to handle API requests securely

Uncomment and modify the callAPI() function in the JavaScript

Replace the placeholder code with your actual API endpoint

Example Backend Code (Node.js/Express)
javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { message } = req.body;
    
    // Example using OpenAI API (would need your API key)
    /* 
    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [{role: "user", content: message}],
      temperature: 0.7
    });
    
    const reply = response.data.choices[0].message.content;
    */
    
    // For now, return a simulated response
    res.json({ reply: "This is a response from the API endpoint" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to get response" });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
Prompt Structure
For best results, structure your prompt with:
